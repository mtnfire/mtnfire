      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m Matt Culbertson—founder of MTN.fire. I was called by God to spread His Word after a radical moment of healing and deliverance. In the spring of 2025, after years of battling PTSD, anxiety, and depression, I encountered the Holy Spirit in a revival that changed everything. That night, Jesus healed me completely—and the vision of fire pouring out from the mountains was born.</p>
      <p>MTN.fire is more than a brand—it’s a calling. I’ve seen the supernatural, I’ve walked through the fire, and now I’m testifying boldly to the goodness of God. My heart burns to see others set free by the power of the Gospel.</p>
      <p>This is just the beginning. Stick around—and let’s shake the mountains together.</p>
